  <p>As Gotham's favored son you will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality.</p>
  <p>It was a dog. It was a big dog.</p>
  <p>You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals. Didn't you think there might be casualties? Things always get worse before they get better.</p>
  <p>If you can tell me the Russian for "apply your own bloody suntan lotion."</p>
  <p>I had a vision of a world without Batman. The Mob ground out a little profit and the police tried to shut them down one block at a time. And it was so boring. I've had a change of heart. I don't want Mr Reese spoiling everything but why should I have all the fun? Let's give someone else a chance. If Coleman Reese isn't dead in 60 minutes then I blow up a hospital.</p>
  <p>Innocence is a strong word to throw around Gotham, Bruce.</p>
  <p>You hung up your cape and your cowl but you didn't move on. You never went to find a life.</p>
  <p>I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.</p>
  <p>I'm not wearing hockey pads.</p>
  <p>I told you I was immortal. Oh there are many forms of immortality.</p>
  <p>If you're good at something, never do it for free.</p>
  <p>Do you feel in charge?</p>
  <p>I honor my father by finishing his work. Vengeance against the man who killed him is simply a reward for my patience.</p>
  <p>You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength.</p>
  <p>There you are! There is nothing to fear but fear itseIf!</p>
  <p>The city needs Bruce Wayne, your resources, your knowledge. It doesn't need your body or your life. That time is past.</p>
  <p>I don't know what you're planning to do with Mr. Wayne's prints, but I'm guessing you'll need his thumb. You don't count so good huh?</p>
  <p>Don't kill him. I want him to feel the heat. Feel the fire of 12 million souls.</p>
